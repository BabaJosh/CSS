                 <span class="emphasizedTerm">Long long ago, </span>  in 1867, Canada was formed by joining some of its territories. The individuals who were in power wanted the country to grow and expand across the territory, just like how the United States was growing. They specifically wanted to get a huge area called Rupert's Land, which was owned by a company called the Hudson's Bay Company. The territory possessed lots of space, natural resources, and fertile land.

                The Canadian government negotiated with Britain and the Hudson's Bay Company to buy Rupert's Land. But even though the land was technically in Canada, it still had many Indigenous people who had been there for a very long time. So Canada had to negotiate treaties which are special agreements with the Indigenous people to share the land.
                Between 1871 and 1921, Canada entered into 11 Numbered Treaties with different Indigenous groups. In the treaties, the Indigenous peoples had agreed to allow Canada to share their land. The government promised to give them things like:

                    <p>Treaty 1, is the first of the numbered treaties signed in Canada between the Anishinaabe and Muskegon Cree peoples, and the Crown. It was signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry in Manitoba. The treaty aimed to establish peace and a relationship between the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples in the area, as it established specific terms of the treaty, including a reserve land allocation and guaranteed hunting and fishing rights.</p>
