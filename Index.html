            <p>The Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and Muskegon Cree nations, which occupied parts of modern-day southern Manitoba, including Winnipeg, signed Treaty 1, the first formal agreement between Indigenous nations and the Canadian government in Manitoba, in August 1871. The treaty promised Indigenous communities benefits like reserves, yearly payments, farming tools, education, and the continued right to hunt and fish, but many of these promises were not fully fulfilled, resulting in ongoing disputes and calls for reconciliation.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each family of five received 160 acres of land</li>
                    <li>Annual payments of $3 per person</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Treaty 1 is special because it established the framework for Canada's subsequent numbered treaties.  In contrast to previous treaties, it had "outside promises"—additional verbal agreements made during negotiations—that weren't initially included in the written version.  These pledges were ultimately recorded in Treaty 2, which contained provisions for schools, animals, and farming implements.  This distinction emphasizes how difficult it was to make sure that every agreement was upheld and how oral traditions continue to influence treaty-making.

            <p>Communities such as <strong>Long Plain First Nation</strong> make use of their treaty rights to build urban reserves and gas stations, among other economic initiatives.  These programs help to maintain their culture and sovereignty while creating jobs, bringing in money, and fostering communal development.  Indigenous communities may guarantee long-term self-sufficiency and boost their economies by utilizing treaty agreements.</p>
